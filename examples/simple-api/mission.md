# Example Mission: Simple Task API

This is an example of how to use AutoClaude for autonomous development.

## Mission Statement

Build a REST API for task management with the following features:

- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Task properties: title, description, status, priority, due date
- Simple authentication using API keys
- SQLite database for persistence
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Docker deployment ready

## Expected Behavior

When launched with this mission, AutoClaude will:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyze requirements
   - Select Flask or FastAPI for Python, or Express for Node.js
   - Research best practices for REST API design

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Design database schema
   - Plan API endpoints and authentication

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Set up project structure
   - Implement models and database
   - Create API endpoints
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Write unit and integration tests

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Generate API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Write deployment instructions

## Launch Command

```bash
./scripts/launch-autonomous.sh "Build a REST API for task management with CRUD operations, API key authentication, SQLite storage, and Docker deployment"
```

## Expected Output

- Fully functional REST API
- Comprehensive test suite
- Docker configuration
- API documentation
- GitHub repository with meaningful commits
